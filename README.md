# Spotify Analytics Web App
A full-stack Flask application that connects to the Spotify Web API and displays personalized listening analytics — including top artists, tracks, albums, and genres — across short-, medium-, and long-term time ranges.

Users securely sign in with Spotify via OAuth 2.0, and the app generates a clean, Spotify-themed dashboard showing their listening habits.
